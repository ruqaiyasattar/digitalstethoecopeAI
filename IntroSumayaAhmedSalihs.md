An Upcoming Open Source Contributer of the Digital Stethoscope AI App

## About me

I am Sumaya Ahmed Salihs. I am Ghanaian by nationality. I have been using flutter professionaly
for two years now. I have used it to build two health application of which one is live on both 
the playstore and appstore. The other is sill awaiting approval from the product owners. I have 
a soft spot for health solutions or application. 

It will really be a great honor and joy to work on the Digital Stethoscope AI App as a Contributer. 
I look forward to working with everyone involved in this project. I have never used ML with any of 
the application I have worked on in the past hence looking forward to leveraging it on this project.
